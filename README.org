#+title: Advent of Code in Racket
#+author: Bart van Nierop

This is Advent of Code, coded in (mostly typed, hopefully) Racket. Initially for
the year 2021, but set up so that more can be done.

* Commands

Some commands are added to ~raco~. These are:


#+begin_src
raco prep [ <option> ... ] [<year>] [<day>]
#+end_src
Prepare a day. Puts a solution template in the file ~year/day.rkt~ and the day's
input in ~year/day.rktd~. Depends on the existence of a file called ~.session~
that contains the session key.

#+begin_src
usage: raco day [ <option> ... ] [<year>] [<day>]

<option> is one of

  -i <infile>, --input <infile>
     Input file name
#+end_src
Run the solution for a day. ~--input~ allows to specify a different input file
than the default one. ~--input~ does not take an extension nor a folder. It
represents a file in the format ~year/<infile>.rktd~.
